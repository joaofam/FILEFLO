Fileflo is a user-friendly file-sharing platform designed to provide a secure, decentralised
alternative to traditional file-sharing services. At its core, Fileflo leverages the InterPlanetary
File System (IPFS) to enable peer-to-peer file-sharing across a network of distributed nodes.
By utilising IPFS, Fileflo ensures that files are not stored on a single centralised server, but
rather across a network of nodes, making them highly available and resilient. In addition to
the distributed storage of files, Fileflo also prioritises user privacy and data security by
encrypting files with both symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms, ensuring that
only the owner of the file, or those they choose to share it with, have access to its contents.
To ensure that files can be easily found and downloaded, Fileflo uploads the metadata of
each file to an Ethereum blockchain. This metadata includes the file's IPFS hash and other
relevant information, which is then used during the download process to locate the file on the
IPFS network and download it. By storing this metadata on the blockchain, Fileflo can
guarantee that each file's provenance and history can be traced back to its original owner,
and that any attempts to modify or delete the file will be recorded on the blockchain. Fileflo
also features an intuitive user interface that allows users to easily upload, share, and
download files. Users can also create shared folders and invite others to join, enabling
seamless collaboration across teams and groups.
